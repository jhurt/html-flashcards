HTML Flashcards
================================

*A webapp for viewing images as flashcards using the [Bottle web framework] (https://github.com/defnull/bottle).*

Any images in static/flashcards are turned into flashcards, with the associated label determined from the name of the image.
For example, with an image named "bald_eagle.png", the associated label will be "bald eagle"

The images currently in the directory are circuit diagram symbols that I'm using to study for the ARRL Amateur Radio license.
Obviously you can fork this and use whatever images you want.
